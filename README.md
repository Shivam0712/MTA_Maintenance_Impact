# Impact of Subway Maintenance on Subway and Taxi Ridership

## Introduction:
MTA has to carry out periodical maintenance which causes a complete or partial shutdown of the subway services at various stations. Due to these frequent maintenance, commuters face inconvenience, and they have to switch to other modes for transportation. Although MTA attempts, to minimize inconvenience to commuters by conducting these activities in night or weekends, it has never been analyzed whether these activities in actual affect subway ridership or not and if yes by how much? A study of this kind will help to estimate the loss of potential ridership, understand avenues where this loss is maximum, identify the causes which are leading to significant loss, loopholes in current maintenance schedule planning and how it could be optimized. Besides, this can also help to study whether the loss in subway ridership creates demand for other modes of transportation. It can be beneficial for the management of taxi fleets as for management of Taxi, and For Hired Vehicles, resource allocations are the top priority and thus, an understanding about potential events which can lead to increase in demand and will help to maximize profits better.

## Research Objectives:
1. To examine whether the ridership on days with maintenance activities is different and lower than the regular days.
2. If the answer to 1 is yes, what are the leading causes of loss in ridership due to maintenance on different subway lines?
3. To examine whether taxi ridership in taxi zones where maintenance was present is higher than regular days.
4.  If the answer to 3 is yes, how to quantify the increase in customer demand?

## Datasets:
1. MTA Turnstile Data: The data shows the entry/exit register values for all turnstiles at all subway stations for any given date.
